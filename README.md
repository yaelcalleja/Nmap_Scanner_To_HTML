Automated nmap services scanner.

This script will execute the scann services of nmap and genarate a HTML file.

The HTML file will have all the filtered information of the scann, but to execute the script nicely
you have to specify the IP direction to scann and a file name to put all the raw information.


To use it:
`cd ~/Nmap_Scanner_To_HTML/`


`./nmap-parser.sh <IP_TO_SCANN> <raw_file.raw>`


Feel free to use it :)
